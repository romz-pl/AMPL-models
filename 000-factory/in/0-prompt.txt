Provide a mathematical model for the following problem.
-----
An engineering factory can produce five types of product (PROD 1, PROD 2, . . . ,
PROD 5) by using two production processes: grinding and drilling.

After deducting raw material costs, each unit of each product yields the
following contributions to proﬁt:
PROD1 £550
PROD2 £600
PROD3 £350
PROD4 £400
PROD5 £200

Each unit requires a certain time on each process. These are given below (in
hours). A dash indicates when a process is not needed.

PROD1 PROD2 PROD3 PROD4 PROD5
Grinding 12 20 - 25 15
Drilling 10  8 16  - -

In addition, the ﬁnal assembly of each unit of each product uses 20 hours of
an employee’s time.

The factory has three grinding machines and two drilling machines and works
a six-day week with two shifts of 8 hours on each day. Eight workers are
employed in assembly, each working one shift a day.

The problem is to ﬁnd how much of each product is to be manufactured so
as to maximize the total proﬁt contribution.
