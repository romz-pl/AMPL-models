Provide mathematical model for the following problem.

# Problem

Sunshine Cruises is a national company specializing
in renting out river-going boats to tourists. The company makes use of two types of
boats — the Premier and the Standard. The Premier is the more expensive boat to
hire and each Premier boat brings in an average net revenue of 800 per week, while
for the Standard the corresponding figure is £600 per week. The company is about
to scrap its older boats and lease new ones and has asked for some advice about
decision making. Decisions to be taken will be based on a scenario of "a typical week."

The company has maximum berthing accommodation around the country for
350 boats in total, of which not more than 200 can be Premier boats. The company
also wants to have no fewer Premier boats than Standard. Maintenance of boats is a
further restriction. Each Premier craft requires 4 h maintenance per week while each
Standard craft requires 3 h. The maximum number of maintenance hours available
per week is 1400 h.
