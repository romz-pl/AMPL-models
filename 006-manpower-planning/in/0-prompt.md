Provide mathematical model for the following problem.

# Problem
A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower
requirements in future years. Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer
unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. In addition
to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the
need for workers in all categories. The estimated manpower requirements for the
next three years are as follows:

|                  | Unskilled | Semi-skilled | Skilled |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Current strength | 2000      | 1500         | 1000    |
| Year 1           | 1000      | 1400         | 1000    |
| Year 2           | 500       | 2000         | 1500    |
| Year 3           | 0         | 2500         | 2000    |

The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to the following over
the next three years:
1. Recruitment
2. Retraining
3. Redundancy
4. Short-time working.

There is a natural wastage of labour. A fairly large number of workers leave
during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. Taking this into
account, the wastage rates can be taken as follows:

|                              | Unskilled (%) | Semi-skilled (%) | Skilled (%) |
|------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Less than one year’s service | 25            | 20               | 10          |
| More than one year’s service | 10            | 5                | 5           |

There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour
force have been employed for more than one year.


## Recruitment
It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. In any one
year, the numbers that can be recruited in each category are as follows:

| Unskilled | Semi-skilled | Skilled |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 500       | 800          | 500     |


## Retraining
It is possible to retrain up to 200 unskilled workers per year to make them semi-skilled.
This costs £400 per worker. The retraining of semi-skilled workers to
make them skilled is limited to no more than one quarter of the skilled labour
force at the time as some training is done on the job. Retraining a semi-skilled
worker in this way costs £500.

Downgrading of workers to a lower skill is possible but 50% of such workers
leave, although it costs the company nothing. (This wastage is additional to the
"natural wastage" described above).


## Redundancy
The redundancy payment to an unskilled worker is £200 and to a semi-skilled
or skilled worker is £500.


## Overmanning
It is possible to employ up to 150 more workers over the whole company than
are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year are as follows:

| Unskilled | Semi-skilled | Skilled |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| £1500     | £2000        | £3000   |


# Short-time working
Up to 50 workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working.
The cost of this (per employee per year) is as follows:

| Unskilled | Semi-skilled | Skilled |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| £500      | £400         | £400    |


An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of
half a full-time employee.

The company's declared objective is to minimise redundancy. How should
they operate in order to do this?
