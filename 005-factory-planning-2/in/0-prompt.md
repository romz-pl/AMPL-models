Provide mathematical model for the following problem.

# Problem
An engineering factory makes seven products (PROD1 to PROD7) on the
following machines: four grinders, two vertical drills, three horizontal drills, one
borer and one planer. Each product yields a certain contribution to proﬁt (defined
as £/unit selling price minus cost of raw materials). These quantities (in £/unit)
together with the unit production times (hours) required on each process are given
below. A dash indicates that a product does not require a process.

|                       | PROD1 | PROD2 | PROD3 | PROD4 | PROD5 | PROD6 | PROD7 |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Contribution to proﬁt | 10    | 6     | 8     | 4     | 11    | 9     | 3     |
| Grinding              | 0.5   | 0.7   | -     | -     | 0.3   | 0.2   | 0.5   |
| Vertical drilling     | 0.1   | 0.2   | -     | 0.3   | -     | 0.6   | -     |
| Horizontal drilling   | 0.2   | -     | 0.8   | -     | -     | -     | 0.6   |
| Boring                | 0.05  | 0.03  | -     | 0.07  | 0.1   | -     | 0.08  |
| Planing               | -     | -     | 0.01  | -     | 0.05  | -     | 0.05  |

Instead of stipulating when each machine is down for maintenance in the factory
planning problem, it is desired to find the best month for each machine to be down.

Each machine must be down for maintenance in one month of the six apart
from the grinding machines, only two of which need be down in any six months.

There are marketing limitations on each product in each month. These are
given in the following table:

|          | PROD1 | PROD2 | PROD3 | PROD4 | PROD5 | PROD6 | PROD7 |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| January  | 500   | 1000  | 300   | 300   | 800   | 200   | 100   |
| February | 600   | 500   | 200   | 0     | 400   | 300   | 150   |
| March    | 300   | 600   | 0     | 0     | 500   | 400   | 100   |
| April    | 200   | 300   | 400   | 500   | 200   | 0     | 100   |
| May      | 0     | 100   | 500   | 100   | 1000  | 300   | 0     |
| June     | 500   | 500   | 100   | 300   | 1100  | 500   | 60    |

It is possible to store up to 100 of each product at a time at a cost of £0.5
per unit per month. There are no stocks at present, but it is desired to have a
stock of 50 of each type of product at the end of June.

The factory works a six days a week with two shifts of 8 h each day.

No sequencing problems need to be considered.

When and what should the factory make in order to maximise the total proﬁt?

Recommend any price increases and the value of acquiring any new machines.

N.B. It may be assumed that each month consists of only 24 working days.
