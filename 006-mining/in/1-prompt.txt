Based on the generated mathematical problem, formulate an AMPL program.
Generate an AMPL model file that is easy to copy in one part.
Generate an AMPL data file that is easy to copy in one part.
Remember that if...then...else expression inside a constraint in AMPL must be used as an expression, not as a statement block like in programming languages.
Remember to use the ordered set if any of the functions ord(), prev(), or first() are used in the AMPL model.
Do not create any user-defined functions, since AMPL does not support user-defined functions.
In AMPL data file:
+ Do not use arithmetic expressions directly.
+ Do not use keyword (tr) for defining sparse 2D parameters.
