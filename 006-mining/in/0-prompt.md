Provide mathematical model for the following problem.

# Problem
A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next
five years. There are four mines in this area, but it can operate at most three in any
one year. Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to
keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future
year. Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently
closed down and no more royalties need be paid. The yearly royalties payable
on each mine kept ‘open’ are as follows:

+ Mine1: £5 million
+ Mine2: £4 million
+ Mine3: £4 million
+ Mine4: £5 million

There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from
each mine in a year. These upper limits are as follows:

+ Mine1: 2 × 10^6 tons
+ Mine2: 2.5 × 10^6 tons
+ Mine3: 1.3 × 10^6 tons
+ Mine4: 3 × 10^6 tons

The ore from the different mines is of varying quality. This quality is
measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination
of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were
combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. Measured in these units the qualities of the ores from
the mines are given as follows:

+ Mine1: 1.0
+ Mine2: 0.7
+ Mine3: 1.5
+ Mine4: 0.5

In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to
produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality. For each year, these
qualities are as follows:

+ Year 1: 0.9
+ Year 2: 0.8
+ Year 3: 1.2
+ Year 4: 0.6
+ Year 5: 1.0

The final blended ore sells for £10 ton each year. Revenue and expenditure
for future years must be discounted at a rate of 10% per annum.

Which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?
