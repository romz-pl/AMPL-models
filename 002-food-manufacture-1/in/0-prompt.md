Provide mathematical model for the following problem.

# Problem
A food is manufactured by reﬁning raw oils and blending them together. The
raw oils are of two categories:
+ Vegetable oils: VEG1, VEG2;
+ Non-vegetable oils: OIL1, OIL2, OIL3;

Each oil may be purchased for immediate delivery (January) or bought on the
futures market for delivery in a subsequent month. Prices at present and in the
futures market are given below in (£/ton):


|          | VEG1 | VEG2 | OIL1 | OIL2 | OIL3 |
|----------|------|------|------|------|------|
| January  | 110  | 120  | 130  | 110  | 115  |
| February | 130  | 130  | 110  | 90   | 115  |
| March    | 110  | 140  | 130  | 100  | 95   |
| April    | 120  | 110  | 120  | 120  | 125  |
| May      | 100  | 120  | 150  | 110  | 105  |
| June     | 90   | 100  | 140  | 80   | 135  |


The final product sells at £150 per ton.

Vegetable oils and non-vegetable oils require different production lines for
refining. In any month, it is not possible to refine more than 200 tons of vegetable
oils and more than 250 tons of non-vegetable oils. There is no loss of weight in
the refining process, and the cost of refining may be ignored.

It is possible to store up to 1000 tons of each raw oil for use later. The cost
of storage for vegetable and non-vegetable oil is £5 per ton per month. The final
product cannot be stored, nor can refined oils be stored.

There is a technological restriction of hardness on the final product. In the
units in which hardness is measured, this must lie between 3 and 6. It is assumed
that hardness blends linearly and that the hardnesses of the raw oils are

VEG1  8.8
VEG2  6.1
OIL1  2.0
OIL2  4.2
OIL3  5.0 

What buying and manufacturing policy should the company pursue in order to
maximise profit?

At present, there are 500 tons of each type of raw oil in storage. It is required
that these stocks will also exist at the end of June.
