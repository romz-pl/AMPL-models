Provide mathematical model for the following problem.
-----
A food is manufactured by refining raw oils and blending them together. The
raw oils come in two categories:
Vegetable oils: VEG1, VEG2
Non-vegetable oils: OIL1, OIL2, OIL3

Vegetable oils and non-vegetable oils require different production lines for reﬁning. 
In any month, it is not possible to reﬁne more than 200 tons of vegetable
oil and more than 250 tons of non-vegetable oils. There is no loss of weight in
the reﬁning process and the cost of reﬁning may be ignored.

There is a technological restriction of hardness in the ﬁnal product. In the
units in which hardness is measured, this must lie between 3 and 6. It is assumed
that hardness blends linearly. The costs (per ton) and hardness of the raw oils are
         VEG1 VEG2 OIL1 OIL2 OIL3
Cost     £110 £120 £130 £110 £115
Hardness  8.8  6.1  2.0  4.2  5.0

The ﬁnal product sells for £150 per ton.

How should the food manufacturer make their product in order to maximize their net profit?
